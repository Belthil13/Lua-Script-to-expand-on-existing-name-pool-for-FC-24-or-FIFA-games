--- This script changes the "has_audio" value for the appropiate names table. The idea is to enable the full name pool for Youth Academy players and Regens/Pregens, as the "has_audio" value caused these names to not be used in the name pool.

-- Get Names Table. Use either "career_firstnames", "career_lastnames" or "career_commonnames) after running it once.

local names_table = LE.db:GetTable("career_firstnames")
local current_record = names_table:GetFirstRecord()

while current_record > 0 do
    names_table:SetRecordFieldValue(current_record, "has_audio", 1)

    current_record = names_table:GetNextValidRecord()
end

-- After you run this for the 3 database tables, run the "reload" command in the Live Editor to update the Database.

--- Bear in mind that this has to be run every time you launch the game, as these are not permanent after closing the game.
