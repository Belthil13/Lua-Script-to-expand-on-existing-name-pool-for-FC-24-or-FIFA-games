--- This script changes the "has_audio" value for the appropiate names table. The idea is to enable the full name pool for Youth Academy players and Regens/Pregens, as the "has_audio" value caused these names to not be used in the name pool.

-- Get Names Table. Use either "career_firstnames", "career_lastnames" or "career_commonnames) after running it once.

-- Get Names Table 1
local names_table = LE.db:GetTable("career_firstnames")
local current_record = names_table:GetFirstRecord()

while current_record > 0 do
    names_table:SetRecordFieldValue(current_record, "has_audio", 1)

    current_record = names_table:GetNextValidRecord()
end

-- Get Names Table 2
local names_table = LE.db:GetTable("career_lastnames")
local current_record = names_table:GetFirstRecord()

while current_record > 0 do
    names_table:SetRecordFieldValue(current_record, "has_audio", 1)

    current_record = names_table:GetNextValidRecord()
end

-- Get Names Table 3
local names_table = LE.db:GetTable("career_commonnames")
local current_record = names_table:GetFirstRecord()

while current_record > 0 do
    names_table:SetRecordFieldValue(current_record, "has_audio", 1)

    current_record = names_table:GetNextValidRecord()

-- After you run this for the 3 database tables, run the "reload" command in the Live Editor to update the Database.

--- Bear in mind that this has to be run every time you launch the game, as these are not permanent after closing the game. For permanent changes, see "Extended Youth Academy Namepool" mod by pup on https://dl.fifa-infinity.com
